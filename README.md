# Parkinson’s Disease Progression Modeling using Machine Learning

This project focuses on analyzing and modeling Parkinson’s disease progression using clinical and biomedical features.  
The objective is to explore disease severity trends, identify influential predictors, and evaluate machine-learning models for progression estimation.

The analysis is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook and follows a structured data science workflow including exploratory analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
